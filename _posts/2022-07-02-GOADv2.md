The second version of Game Of Active directory is out ! [https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD)
I spent months to setup this new lab, with a bunch of new features and the result is finally available.

With this new lab i worked to add the following features :
- Multi domains and multi forest :
    - Now there is child/parent domain with sevenkingdoms.local and north.sevenkingdoms.local
    - A separate forest as essos.local to train the forest to forest technics
- IIS :
    - A IIS server is available on castelblack.north.sevenkingdoms.local with the ability to upload asp to get a shell
- MSSQL :
    - Two mssql servers are now avaiable, one in castelblack.north.sevenkingdoms.local and another on braavos.sevenkingdoms.local
    - The two servers are linked to test mssql trusted link.
    - Impersonation configuration are also set up on the mssql server
- Anonymous user listing:
    - An anonymous user listing is now available in winterfell.north.sevenkingdoms.local
- ADCS :
    - One of the biggest improvement of v2 with the multi domains is that an ADCS server is available on essos.local and with missconfigurations to try at least esc1 to 3 and esc8.

## Installation
- First you need a big computer to get the lab up and running. Mine is a 8cpu/32Go RAM.
- Maybe a 4CPU/16Go could be enought but i am really not sure about it as there is 5 windows VM to launch !

```
git clone https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD.git
```

- we start by launching vagrant to get all the vm and let vagrant provide them 
```bash
vagrant up
```

- one we get all the vm up and running it's time to provision them with ansible
- we install all the needed packages and launch the main.yml playbook

```bash
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
cd ansible
python3.8 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install ansible-core==2.12.6
python3 -m pip install pywinrm
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

- if there is error we just relaunch `ansible-playbook main.yml` until we get no failure during the installation.

## Lab running

- we check the lab with cme
```bash
cme smb 192.168.56.0/24
```

- All is ok, let's start to pwn the lab !
